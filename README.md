Intracranial neoplasms, commonly referred to as brain tumors, are a collection of abnormal cells that forms within the brain. These cells reproduce at an alarming rate, which can increase pressure inside the skull and damage nearby brain tissue. A 2022 study revealed a significant increase (around 94%) in brain cancers between 1990 and 2019. Over 300,000 cases of brain tumors are reported annually worldwide. MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging) is often the preferred choice for diagnosing brain tumors. 

Artificial neural networks (ANNs), particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have demonstrated remarkable efficiency in segmenting MRI images. By using vast datasets of labeled MRI scans, CNNs can be trained to analyze new scans and predict the probability of specific disease. In this project, we have developed a deep learning model based on CNN architecture specifically designed to identify and classify brain tumors into three distinct categories: glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors. The proposed CNN model, consist of three convolutional layers, and achieved an accuracy of 92%.
